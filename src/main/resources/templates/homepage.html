    <p>Too many books in your bookcase? Lost count of how many you read, or how many are still waiting to finally be dusted off?</p>
    <p>Now, with your very own anthology, you can easily keep track of your ever-growing hoard of books!</p><br>
    <p>In your personal anthology, you can record which books you own, which are read or unread,</p>
    <p>and which books you just have to buy even though your bookcase is filled to the brim.</p><br>
